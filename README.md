# Performance Analysis for Image Rendering on different Operating Systems

This investigation aims to compare statistically the
image rendering performance using PBRT V3 (Physically Based
Rendering) framework across different operating systems, includ-
ing Windows, Linux, and virtual machines on same computer.
PBRT V3 is an open source tool, physically based rendering
system developed for computer graphics and rendering research,
it is designed to simulate light transport in virtual scenes to create
highly realistic and visually accurate images.
